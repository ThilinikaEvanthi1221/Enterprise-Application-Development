# Implementation Summary: Services & Modification Requests

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive backend system for **automobile service requests** and **vehicle modification/project requests** with role-based access control, automatic cost estimation, and complete CRUD operations.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. **Enhanced Data Models**

#### Service Model (`backend/models/service.js`)

- **Fields Added:**
  - `serviceType`: Predefined service categories (Oil Change, Brake Service, etc.)
  - `customer`: Link to customer who requested
  - `vehicle`: Link to vehicle being serviced
  - `estimatedCost`: Auto-calculated cost
  - `actualCost`: Final cost after completion
  - `laborHours`: Estimated/actual labor time
  - `partsRequired`: Array of parts with costs
  - `progress`: 0-100% completion tracker
  - `customerNotes`: Customer's special requests
  - Status workflow: requested → pending → approved → ongoing → completed/cancelled

#### Project Model (`backend/models/project.js`)

- **Fields Added:**
  - `modificationType`: Types of vehicle modifications
  - `customer`: Link to customer
  - `vehicle`: Link to vehicle
  - `estimatedCost` & `actualCost`: Cost tracking
  - `laborHours` & `partsRequired`: Resource planning
  - `priority`: low/medium/high/urgent (affects cost)
  - `milestones`: Track project phases
  - `progress`: Completion percentage
  - `images`: Store modification photos
  - Enhanced status workflow with milestone tracking

### 2. **Cost Estimation Engine** (`backend/utils/costEstimator.js`)

#### Features:

- **Service Cost Calculation:**
  - Base costs for each service type
  - Labor rate tiers (Standard: $50/hr, Specialized: $75/hr)
  - Parts cost aggregation
  - 10% contingency buffer
- **Project Cost Calculation:**
  - Base costs for modification types
  - Higher labor rates ($100/hr for modifications)
  - Priority multipliers (urgent: +30%, high: +15%)
  - 15% contingency for custom work
- **Actual Cost Tracking:**
  - Calculate final costs based on actual hours and parts used
  - Compare estimated vs. actual for reporting

#### Cost Formula:

```
Service: Base + (Hours × Rate) + Parts + 10% Contingency
Project: (Base + Labor + Parts) × Priority Multiplier + 15% Contingency
```

### 3. **Role-Based Controllers**

#### Services Controller (`backend/controllers/servicesController.js`)

**Customer Functions:**

- ✅ `requireCustomer()` - Customer or Admin only
- ✅ `requireCustomerOrEmployee()` - Any authenticated user

### 5. **Comprehensive Routes**

## How It Works

### Customer Journey (Service Request)

1. Customer logs in and gets JWT token
2. Customer submits service request with vehicle and service type
3. **System automatically calculates estimated cost**
4. Service created with status "requested"
5. Admin approves and optionally assigns employee
6. Employee claims or gets assigned, starts work (status: "ongoing")
7. Employee updates progress (0% → 50% → 100%)
8. Employee marks complete, actual cost calculated
9. Customer sees real-time updates throughout

### Customer Journey (Modification Request)

1. Customer requests modification with details
2. **System calculates cost including priority adjustments**
3. Project created with status "requested"
4. Admin reviews, approves, sets priority
5. Employee claims project
6. Employee adds milestones (e.g., "Parts Ordered", "Installation Started")
7. As milestones complete, progress auto-updates
8. Employee marks complete with final costs
9. Customer sees milestones and progress in real-time

### Employee Workflow

1. Login and view assigned work
2. OR view available work and claim
3. Update status as work progresses
4. Add notes for customer visibility
5. For projects: add and complete milestones
6. Mark complete with actual hours and parts used
7. System calculates actual cost

---

## Security & Access Control

### Data Isolation

- **Customers** can ONLY see/modify their own requests
- **Employees** can ONLY update assigned work
- **Admins** have full access

### Vehicle Ownership Verification

- System verifies vehicle belongs to customer before accepting request
- Prevents requesting services for other people's vehicles

### Status Workflow Protection

- Customers cannot cancel completed work
- Projects >50% complete cannot be customer-cancelled
- Only assigned employees can update progress

---

## Database Design Highlights

### Indexes for Performance

```javascript
// Services
serviceSchema.index({ customer: 1, status: 1 });
serviceSchema.index({ assignedTo: 1, status: 1 });
serviceSchema.index({ vehicle: 1 });

// Projects
projectSchema.index({ customer: 1, status: 1 });
projectSchema.index({ assignedTo: 1, status: 1 });
projectSchema.index({ vehicle: 1 });
projectSchema.index({ status: 1, priority: -1 });
```

### Population for Rich Responses

All endpoints automatically populate:

- Customer details (name, email)
- Vehicle details (make, model, year, plate)
- Assigned employee details (name, email)

---

## Cost Estimation Examples

### Service: Oil Change

```
Base Cost: $40
Labor: 0.5 hours × $50/hr = $25
Parts: 5 quarts × $8.99 = $44.95
Subtotal: $109.95
Contingency (10%): $11.00
ESTIMATED TOTAL: $120.95
```

### Project: Custom Paint Job (High Priority)

```
Base Cost: $800
Labor: 12 hours × $100/hr = $1,200
Parts: $500 (paint materials)
Subtotal: $2,500
Priority Adjustment (High +15%): $2,875
Contingency (15%): $431.25
ESTIMATED TOTAL: $3,306.25
```

1. ✅ **Clear role separation** (Customer/Employee/Admin)
2. ✅ **Automatic cost estimation** with transparent breakdown
3. ✅ **Real-time progress tracking** (0-100% with milestones)
4. ✅ **Complete CRUD operations** for all roles
5. ✅ **Secure access control** (can only access owned/assigned data)
6. ✅ **Scalable design** (indexes, population, validation)
7. ✅ **Well-documented API** with examples
